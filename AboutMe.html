        <p>
            I graduated with honours from Holy Cross High School in Saskatoon,
            Saskatchewan. I currently attend the University of Saskatchewan pursing
            a bachelor's in computer science. I have taken CMPT 280 with an in depth
            understanding of data structures and algorithms. I have also taken CMPT 215
            with an understanding of base computer architecture and organization.
